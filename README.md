# AgriData Explorer: A Data Visualization Platform for Indian Agriculture

## 🌾 Overview

India’s agricultural sector is vital to the country's economy and sustains millions of livelihoods. However, stakeholders such as farmers, policymakers, and researchers struggle with fragmented, inaccessible agricultural data. This project aims to bridge that gap by building a comprehensive data visualization platform that integrates district-level crop production data from across India.

Using Python (for EDA and preprocessing), SQL (for data storage and querying), and Power BI (for interactive dashboards), this project provides visual insights into crop area, production, and yield across various regions. It is intended to support:
- **Farmers** in making informed crop selection decisions.
- **Policymakers** in identifying low-productivity zones and allocating resources effectively.
- **Researchers** in studying long-term agricultural trends and innovations.

## 📊 Dataset

**Source**: ICRISAT – District Level Agricultural Data  
**Primary File**: `ADE_source_data.csv`  

This dataset contains district-level statistics on crop area, production, and yield for key Indian crops like Rice, Wheat, Oilseeds, Cotton, Sugarcane, and more. Data fields include:

- **Geographic Fields**: State Code, State Name, District Code, District Name, Year
- **Crop Metrics**: Area (1000 ha), Production (1000 tons), Yield (kg/ha)
- **Crops Included**: Rice, Wheat, Maize, Groundnut, Sugarcane, Cotton, Oilseeds, Pulses, Fruits, Vegetables, etc.

Cleaned data is saved in `cleaned_agriculture_data.csv`, and is ready for SQL insertion and dashboard integration.
